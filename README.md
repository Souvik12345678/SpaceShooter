# SpaceShooter
 A modified version of Unity Multiplayer Tutorial

This is a modified/remixed version of the 
 [2D Space Shooter Sample](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.samples.bitesize/tree/main/Basic/2DSpaceShooter) created by **Unity**.

### With added features like:
- Play in a LAN Party.
- Players can play from both Android/PC.
- Auto Local IP detection.
- Bugs.
- And a new spaceship.

### Instructions
The game can be played in 2 ways :<br>
#### Gamemode A :
- One player has to join as host.
- Other players has to join as client.
- The host device will have the advantage of the lowest latency.
#### Gamemode B :
- One device has to join as server.
- Other players has to join as client.
- The server device cannot play the game.

**Players can join from both PC and Android and must be on same LAN/WiFi.**

**Playable versions are in Assets/Scenes/MyScenes**

### Bugs
- If something does not work properly just restart.
- There is a bug where if it fails to connect it just shows a blank screen instead of a helpful message. Just restart the game and check your connection
to the WiFi/LAN.
